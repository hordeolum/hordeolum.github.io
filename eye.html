    <h2 id="h2"><b>REFRACTIVE ERRORS:</b></h2> 
    <u>Myopia/Nearsightedness ( Negative refractive state ):</u>Inability to see distance objects clearly.<br><br>
    <u>Hyperopia/Farsightedness ( Positive refractive state ):</u> May have problems seeing near objects clearly at an old age.<br><br>
   LENSES:<br><br>
    <b>Minus lenses (-)</b>: Lenses used by nearsighted people 
    in order to see distance objects clearly, has the effect of making things appear as if they are closer. These glasses are thinner in the center, and thicker on the outside 
    <br><br> 
    <b>Plus lenses (+)</b>: Reading glasses, normally used by old
    people for reading, has the effect of making things appear as if they are further away. These glasses are thicker in the center, and thinner on the outside <img src="https://www.jins.com/us/media/wysiwyg/LensGuide/new/plus-lens.png" class="img">

    <u><span style="font-size:35px;">Diopters and how do they work</u></span><br>
<br>
    Diopters are basically 1 divided by the distance in meters. For instance, a person who is 
    2 diopters nearsighted, can only see up to 0.5 meters clearly (1/0.5 in meters = 2)
     A person who sees clearly up until 25cm or 0.25m is 4 diopters myopic. (1/0.25 = 4)
      A person who can see up to 1.33 meters clearly is 0.75D myopic (1/1.33 = 0.75)<br><br>
      So you can basically quickly measure your eyesight with a ruler, you measure the distance until you notice very slight blur, in good lighting
      in front of your computer for example, you then do 1 divided by that distance in meters, and that is approximately your distance prescription. Ordering these glasses will give you 20/20 or better vision (normal)<br><br>
<b>Visual acuity</b><br><br>Distance measured in feet or meters, written as 20/20 (6/6 in meters), 20/30 20/40 etc. <br>
20/20 (6/6) means that you can see at 20 feet what a normal person sees at 20 feet. <br>
20/40 (6/12) - 50% of normal vision - you can see at 20 feet what a normal person sees at 40 feet 
<br>20/10 (6/3) - twice as good as normal vision - you can see at 20 feet what a normal person sees at 10 feet<br><br>
*Normal people can actually see better than 20/20, but it was taken as a standard and an average vision of older people.<br>
*In order to legally drive a vehicle without glasses only 20/40 is required

    <br><br>
    <b><u>THE ACCOMMODATION SYSTEM</u></b> <br><br>
    
    The ability of the lens to thicken itself in order to focus on near objects. The closer one is looking, the more the lens has to thicken itself in order to focus the light on the retina.
    <br>Looking up close is considered "strain" when done for long periods of time.
    A person with normal vision, assuming 0.00 diopters, looking at his screen from 0.5 meters or 50cm - 
    the lens needs to "accommodate" - thicken itself by 1/0.5 = 2 diopters.
    When looking at a smartphone from 0.33m (33cm) , 1/0.33 = 3 diopters - the lens needs to
    accommodate 3 diopters in order to see it clearly. When looking at the distance, theoretically infinity - the lens 
    is completely thin/relaxed with zero accommodation.<br>
    The lens' ability to accommodate in order to see near objects clearly is controlled by a circular
    muscle, the focusing muscle also known as the ciliary muscle.

    <br><br>
    <u>THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEARSIGHTEDNESS:</u> <br><br>
    <b><span style="color: rgb(64, 152, 224)">PSEUDOMYOPIA</span></b>:<br>
    Excessive accommodation leads to lens spasm. The focusing muscle locks up, the lens is then stuck in close up mode hence distance objects are blurred
    
    
    <br><br>
    <b><span style="color: purple">AXIAL MYOPIA:</span></b><br>
    The eyeball  is longer than normal, when looking at the distance light is focused in front of the retina
    resulting in a blurred distance image. <br><br>
    <b><u><span style="font-size: 35px">FROM PSEUDOMYOPIA TO REAL MYOPIA</u></b></span>
<Br><br> In pseudomyopia, the focusing muscle is stuck in close up mode. This doesnt resolve after a 
    night's sleep and stimulates the eyeball to grow longer to compensate for it.<br>
    The eyeball elongates directly in response to near vision stimulus in the long run - normal mechanism and happens in all eyes.
As explained above, minus lenses (distance glasses for myopia) optically move everything closer to the eyes,
so when using these, especially for near > the focusing effort increases thus stimulating MORE eye growth, faster.
This obviously happens more the younger you are but can happen to adults as well.
